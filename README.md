# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

**This is my fullstack coding bootcamp prework study guide**

- I was motivated to start this class to further my knowledge in website development to reach my companies ultimate goal of becoming self sufficient in website maintenance
- I built this project to have a single source go to place to store my notes for the prework class
- By building this project, I was able to accomplish the goal of storing my notes on one site, instead of having to go to multiple places to find the notes I had been taking
- I learned a ton of information while building this project not limited to: git, github, command functions, markdown, html, css, java, etc...


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This project is pretty simple. Each section contains notes about the topics we learned during our prework (HTML, CSS, GIT, JAVA) Furthermore, if we open the Google Chrome DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first, once done with that topic you can simply refresh the page and another random topic will be generated.
