      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Think of HTML as the bare bones of website building, the frame/structure of the house if you will</li>

        <Li>CSS is what gives your website it's unique look and feel</Li>
        <li>Think of CSS as the paint and color of the home building process</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the html file and only apply on that page</li>
        <li>external style sheet is the most common method which allows developers to keep their rules in a separate file, which makes changes easier</li>

      <h2>GIT</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter your Git notes here</li>
        <li>GIT is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub that happens locally on your computer</li>
        <li>GITHub is where your coding for your website is stored</li>
        <li>You have one main branch, which is your active live site coding</li>
        <li>you can have several off branches from the main branch that will allow you to make edits to the code that will not effect the main branch</li>
        <li>this also allows multiple developers to work on multiple issues at the same time</li>
        <li>once you have made the necessary updates in an off branch, you can have another developer review your updates</li>
        <li>once updates have been reviewed, you can merge this off branch back into the main branch</li>
        <li>this is where your updated coding will take effect into the main live site</li>
        <li>git codes are always prefaced with git</li>
        <li>examples include
          <li>git status:checks what branch we are currently on
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <li>Java is how your website interacts</li>
        <li>think of java as the process of you going through doors, using appliances, etc in your new home</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <li>Java is read from top to bottom</li>
